# Calory Tracker

Caroly Tracker app is built with Jetpack Compose UI toolkit. It uses libraries from Jetpack (like Hilt, ViewModels, Room, Navigation) and also other 3rd party libraries like Retrofit for network request, Coil to load images from the network, Mockk to mock classes and webservice when testing the app. 

The app is a practical course from Philips Lackner, here is the [link](https://pl-coding.com/multi-module-course/). It teaches best practices and tricks to build complex applications like a multimodular app.
